# Fishing Detection  
  
This project repo is a continuation of [Fishing Detection](https://github.com/seankim658/Fishing-Detection) using a long short-term memory model. The data contains [anonymized AIS data](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-training-data-v1) collected by the [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/). Due to the combined size of the data and Github's bandwidth/storage limiations on free accounts, the 7 csv files are only saved locally. They can be downloaded from the link above.
